# DiscordAccountsBot

> Discord bot for managing Freeside accounts

This Discord bot manages accounts on the Freeside network, but may be useful in other contexts. It is currently a work in progress, but will plan it to be able to:

 - Create new user accounts, automatically assigning roles depending on the source Discord server
 - Assign and unassign roles
 - Reset passwords
 - Disable accounts and assign to an alumni role


## System Requirements
 - A *recent* version of Node.js
 - Python 3 + pip
 - Linux (Windows may work but is untested)


## Getting Started
TODO: Write getting started instructions here.


## Documentation
Usage and development documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory: [DiscordAccountsBot documentation](docs/)
