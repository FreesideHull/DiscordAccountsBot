> Discord bot for managing Freeside accounts

This Discord bot manages accounts on the Freeside network, but may be useful in other contexts. It is currently a work in progress, but will plan it to be able to:

 - Assign and unassign roles
 - Reset passwords
 - Create new accounts
 - Disable accounts or manage permissions


## System Requirements
